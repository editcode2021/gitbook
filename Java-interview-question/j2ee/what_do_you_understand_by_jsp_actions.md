# What do you understand by JSP Actions?

JSP actions are XML tags that direct the server to use existing components or control the behavior of the JSP engine.

There are six JSP Actions:

* < jsp : include / >
* < jsp : forward / >
* < jsp : plugin / >
* < jsp : usebean / >
* < jsp : setProperty / >
* < jsp : getProperty / >
